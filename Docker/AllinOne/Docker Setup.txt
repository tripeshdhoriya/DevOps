#######YellowHamme Docker Setup##########

- Download desktop deocker for windows https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
- For creating images for server
	-  Keep place DockerfileServer file on YH-server folder where jre and start-server file existed
	-  make sure jre shold be compitabel with Linux 
	-  Chnage acording jre path in start-server.sh if required
	-  If all things are looks ready then run DockerfileServer file on powershell from existing path.
	-  keep DockerfileServer over the path as like PATH:C:\SigmaStream\YellowHammer\YellowHammer-Server\YellowHammer-Server\DockerfileServer
	-  Run command to build Yh-server image - docker build -t yh-server -f .\DockerfileServer .  (for server) 
	-  Check on docker images or container section where new images and container will be create
	
- for creating image for webclient
	- Keep place DockerfileClient file on YH-webclient folder where jre and start-server file existed
	- make sure jre shold be compitabel with Linux 
	- Chanage acording jre path in start-server.sh if required
	- If all things are looks ready then run DockerfileClient file on powershell from existing path.
	- keep DockerfileServer over the path as like PATH:C:\SigmaStream\YellowHammer\YellowHammer-WebClient\yellowhammer-webclient\DockerfileServer
	- Run command to build YH-client image - docker build -t yh-webclient -f .\DockerfileClient .
    - Check on docker images or container section where new images and container will be create
	
- For Composed file you need to create SigmaStream directory and place here docker-compose.yml and other important 
	- Before run we need to create AppData director in the SigmaStream.
	- Pleace here docker-compose.yml and postgres.env in SigmaStream
	- Now We need to please some of file or directory on AppData directory as like below:
		- data-files
		- deploy
		- i18n 
		- logs
		- patches
		- template
		- config-ext.properties
		- Start.ini file 





#######YellowHammer Setup with docker image.#########

1) Download Docker Desktop for Windows from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/.
2) Extract the "SigmaStream.zip" file, which you will obtain from SigmaStream.
3) After extracting the .zip file, you will find the following items:
		- AppData
		- docker-compose.yml
		- postgres.env
		- mongo
		- postgres
		- yh-client.tar (Docker image for YH-webclient)
		- yh-server.tar (Docker image for YH-server)
4) Now we need to import the Docker images into Docker containers.
5) Open PowerShell at the location of the image files and run the following commands to import them:
		- For the server: docker load -i yh-server.tar
		- For the web client: docker load -i yh-client.tar
6) Once the image loading is complete, both images will appear in the Docker image section.
7) Next, we need to run the composed file.
		- Open PowerShell at the location of the Docker Compose file.
		- Make sure all the files are present in this location, and also check the postgres directory for the presence of the yh_dump.sql file; otherwise, the database will not be restored.
8) After verifying all the items, run the composed file using the following command: docker-compose up -d
9) Check the logs to ensure that all items are starting properly. Now, you can access both URLs in your browser: https://IP-Address:8081 (YH-Server) and https://IP:Address://8082 (YH-webclient).
10) When logging into YH-webclient, you will encounter a license_key error. To resolve this, you need to generate a public key for your machine using the instructions provided during the YH-client login process.
	- For the login into Yh-client 
		Server URL - https://IP-Address:8081
		Username - RigAdmin
		Password - SigmaStream#1
11) Send the generated public key to support@sigmastrem.com, and you will receive a license_key from SigmaStream.
12) Set this license_key in D:\SigmaStream\AppData\config-ext.properties file and restart the server composed file.
